This is a simple, straightforward, single-file web crawler written in Python 3.14. It is intended to be used as a command line utility. It does not import any modules except for those which as far as I know are unavoidable, like using `sys` to grab command-line arguments.

This README will serve as exposition and a kind of tutorial for how this code was written.

We will use a `pyproject.toml` file to specify that this project requires Python version 3.14.
